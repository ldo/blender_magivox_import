This is my attempt at an importer for bringing models in the
MagicaVoxel <https://github.com/ephtracy/voxel-model> file format into
Blender. It tries to construct minimal meshes, so adjacent voxel cubes
that share a face are coalesced into bigger shapes without interior
faces.

The Blender addon is just the one file magivox_import.py -- the util
subdirectory contains utility scripts used during testing. The
make-shape script generates some relatively simple test shapes; it
outputs a format I call “jvox”, which is a JSON representation of the
contents of a .vox file. The other scripts, jvox_to_vox and
vox_to_jvox, allow interconversions between this format and .vox
format.
